# Project-CS180 Team-L

# IMDB Datastore

## Project Description

The system will consist of a database of movies, and perhaps eventually TV shows. In addition to the movie title and rating, the database will include the cast, genre, as well as director. The database will be managed through a front-end GUI, where CRUD operations can be executed. CRUD operations can also be performed in the command line as well.

## Team Members

- Brian Porter
- Nicky Lin
- Johnny To

## Objectives

- Create a database from scratch that is able to do basic CRUD Operations.
- Create a frontend GUI where developers can manage database.

## Technologies Used

- C++ for the database
- Javascript (Electron.js) HTML, CSS
